SiteConfigSettings
==================

ProcessWire Site Config Settings module would create some of the common 
fields where we need on every Processwire site profile.

## Overview

I have done couple of projects(websites) using ProcessWire. 
I realized that we use same common fields to to store some data in every project. 
Therefore I build this module to create some fields automatically during the installation 
of this module. Idea is to save some time without doing same process over and over.
 
### How to install

1. Copy all of the files for this module into /site/modules/SiteConfigSettings/

2. In your admin, go to the Modules screen and "check for new modules." Click *install*
   for the SiteConfigSettings 

3. In your admin, go to Setup > Fields. You would see some fields generated using this module.
